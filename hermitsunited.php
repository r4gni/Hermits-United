King Louis: I'm the King of France! Doctor Who: Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time
Ah! Yes! Blimey, sorry! Christmas Eve on a rooftop I saw a chimney... my whole brain just went... What the hell!
Do you know, in 900 years of time and space, I've never met anyone who wasn't important.
I think you'll find that I'm universally recognized as a mature and responsible adult. Finally, a lie too big.
It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
Geronimo!
Bow ties are cool.
Amelia: You said you were in the library. The Doctor: So was the swimming pool.
Rory: We are not her boys. The Doctor: Yeah, we are. Rory: Yeah, we are.

Reinette: Oh, this is my lover, the King of France. The Doctor: Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time.
Hermits United. We meet up every ten years. Swap stories about caves. It's good fun... for a hermit.";
